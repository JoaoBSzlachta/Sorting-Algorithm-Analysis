# Sorting-Algorithm-Analysis
In this repository, there are analyses of four sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort.

This repository was created to store and display all four sorting algorithms. It was a project assigned by Professor Tania C. K. Goulart as part of a calculus course. Our task was to write code that collects and displays the running times of these four sorting algorithms. We then compared the running times among them and plotted the curves to visualize their performance.
